<p><em>North Olmsted, Ohio...</em>&nbsp;Yesterday, Time Inc.'s&nbsp;<em><strong>This Old House</strong></em>&nbsp;named Magnetix™ hand showers from Moen to its fifth annual&nbsp;<strong>"This Old House Top 100,"</strong>&nbsp;a list of the 100 best new home products of the year. Each year, the editors spend months scouting, testing, and culling countless new home products to identify the most distinctive, useful and innovative in seven categories, including the bath. Magnetix was selected for its powerful magnetic dock that allows for easy release of the hand shower, as well as a secure return back into place -- even when your eyes are closed.</p>
<p>"Magnetix is one of those products that makes you wonder, 'why has no one thought of this before?'" says Scott Omelianuk, editor at&nbsp;<em>This Old House</em>. "The addition of a magnet to the dock is ingenious -- it's an elegantly simple, but impactful, solution to a common household problem, the hand shower slipping from the dock. As soon as we saw it, we knew it had to be one of our Top 100. Home companies release thousands of new products every year, and our job is to highlight the ones with staying power -- those that are in some way brilliant and will make our readers' lives better...Magnetix definitely fits the bill."</p>
<p>In addition to the magnetic dock, Magnetix showerheads also feature six high-performance spray options to customize the showering experience, with the choice of a dial or push button to change between settings. A flexible, 60-inch metal hose offers greater reach in the tub or shower -- allowing consumers to accomplish other tasks, such as bathing children, washing pets and cleaning the shower, with ease. A lower showerhead provides easier access for those with limited mobility.</p>
<p>"We are incredibly honored that Magnetix has been included in this year's Top 100 list," says Maribeth Kwasniewski, director of retail marketing, Moen. "At Moen, it's our mission to create solutions that fulfill unmet consumer needs, improving homeowners' everyday interactions with products in the kitchen and bath. With Magnetix, we've transformed the traditional hand shower experience, making it easier and more intuitive, and we're thrilled to be recognized by&nbsp;<em>This Old House</em>&nbsp;for this innovation."</p>
